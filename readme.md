###Philadelphia City Council Data

This website allows users to see the breakdown of Philadelphila City Council members for any year by gender, race, and party affiliation.
It also allows users to see a breakdown of how councilmembers left office -- resignation, retirement, etc.
Lastly, it allows users to see what turnover was like in City Council.

Data was collected through a lot of tedious internet research and is stored in a pg database that the website uses.  A csv of a database query can be found in this repo as well.

It's deployed to heroku.  See it live here:  http://phl-citycouncil.herokuapp.com
